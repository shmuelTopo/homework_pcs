Reminder - there probably will not be class next Sunday night. Class president is going to take a vote to see if we should have class Monday night instead. We will keep you posted...

  

Files from last night's class have been uploaded to Dropbox and pushed to GitHub.

For homework:

Continue styling your restaurant with some of the new html elements and css we learnt. In particular do the following:  
1 - Use the new types of selectors we saw:  

> id selectors - e.g. #copyright
> 
> class selectors - e.g. .menuItem

You can of course use these in combination so #copyright .menuItem p {} would apply to all paragraphs in an element with class menuItem in the element with id of copyright...  
  
2 - Use at least 10 of the new css rules we saw, somewhere in your site.  

-   font-weight
-   font-style
-   text-decoration
-   text-shadow
-   letter-spacing
-   line-height
-   text-transform (capitalize, uppercase etc)
-   transform (translate, rotate, scale, skew)
-   padding
-   margin
-   width
-   height

We saw vertical-align, display, box-sizing, and overflow as well. These may be useful to you depending on what you're doing.

I think that's all the ones we've seen so far (plus the ones listed in last homework that you should already be using and list specific ones like list-style-type and list-style-image - see below where a list is needed so the list specific rules might come in handy there)  
  
3 - Make your pages not full width on a big screen - yet responsive so as to not cause scrolling on a small screen (e.g. max-width or width using %) as we did in class (reminder flexbox and css grid which we will see later can often be better choices for layout problems)  
  
4 - Put (at least some of) your links (anchors) in a nav (navigation) element (if not already in one - we did that in class last time) and a list element (probably a UL) - after all, semantically it is a  **list** of  **links**... Style as needed (recall we made an inline list in class if that's a style you would find useful...)

  

5 - Style (at least some of ) your \<a> elements (recall that besides basic styles on an a element you can also target the pseudo class selectors a:link, a:visited, a:hover, a:focus, and a:active)

  

6 - rename your home page - index.html if not named that already!
