    <h1>Rib eye steak</h1>
    <p>
        The rib eye or ribeye is a boneless rib steak from the rib section. <br>
        The rib section of beef spans from ribs six through twelve. <br>
        Ribeye steaks are mostly composed of the longissimus dorsi muscle <br> 
        but also contain the complexus and spinalis muscles.

    <h2>Terminology</h2>
    <p>
        In the United States cuisine, a bone-attached beef rib can be called <br>
        "rib steak", "beef rib", "bone-in beef rib","tomahawk steak", <br> 
        "bone-in rib steak", "ribeye steak" or "cowboy cut". <br>
        In Australia and New Zealand, a bone-in rib steak is called a "ribeye". <br> 
        When the bone is removed, Australians and New Zealanders call the resulting piece of meat <br> 
        a "Scotch fillet" or "whiskey fillet".
