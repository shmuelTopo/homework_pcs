Files from last night's class have been committed to Git and uploaded to Dropbox. (Sorry for the delay but we had network issues which caused problems with the screen cast. Fixing messed up screen casts takes a long time unfortunately) 
For homework:
Create the following class and subcllass  (this exercise may be similar to a Java inheritance example done earlier in the year.)
Create a Vehicle class. Allow callers to pass in a color when creating an instance which will then be set as that objects color. Vehicles should also have a function "go" that takes a speed. When "go" is called, vehicle should set its speed and print out that it is "now going at speed X". Vehicles should also have a print method that prints their color and current speed to the console.
Create a Plane class. Plane should extend Vehicle, but plane should have its own "go" method that instead of printing "now going at speed X" should print "now FLYING at speed X".
Create a vehicle and a plane, make them go, call their print functions. Verify that both go methods print the appropriate message for the type of object. Verify that print outputs the current speed and color for both objects.
Implement "Fizz buzz" in Python. Loop through numbers from 1 to 100, For each number print out the number, but if the number is evenly divisible by 3 print the word "Fizz" instead. If the number is evenly divisible by 5 print the word "Buzz" instead. If the number is evenly divisible by both 3 and 5 print "Fizz Buzz" instead. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz   (You may have done a Fizzbuzz like example earlier in the year in Java).
As discussed we are now finished with the Python portion of the course and will begin HTML/CSS next class. I did a quick google search for python practice exercises and found - http://www.practicepython.org/ Looks like it has some nice exercises for you to practice what we covered and even learn some new things we didn't get to if you would like to further build your Python skills. Im sure there are many others as well.
